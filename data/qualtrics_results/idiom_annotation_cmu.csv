Sometimes is hard to decide whether it requires another inference step to understand the given phrase, e.g. ""public use"" can be naively understood as ""used by the public"", but also has a more juridical meaning like ""public benefit"" or ""public advantage"". It is hard to tell whether this is fully or somewhat compositional. 
2. Some phrase vaguely makes sense, but strictly do not, such as ""thought an occasion"" or ""are of pattern"". And some need to be understood with surrounding contexts: for example, ""spirit is spirit"" does not make much sense by itself, but quite commonly appears in the sentence ""that which is born of the Spirit is spirit"" (and the low-case normalization of the first 'Spirit' seems like a problem?).

Also compositionality can be in terms of x+yz, or x+y+z as a whole - sometimes, a phrase could be compositional in terms of x and yz but the yz part could be non compositional.
